                <p class="text-faded">Hi! I'm Kelsey, a 21 year-old developer from London. I'm a recent law graduate who has been programming for a few months now, specialising in HTML, CSS, Javascript and learning many more. I'm currently completing my Master's degree in Computer Science and hope to establish a career in software development! In the meantime though, I enjoy creating websites for clients and working on my own personal projects. Feel free to browse what I've created and get in contact if you'd like some work done!</p>
